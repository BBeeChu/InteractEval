In this task, you need to examine each sub-question for evaluating the {} of the summary of the original document. 
The definition of {} are provided below. 

# Definition
{}

Each sub-question must satisfy the following conditions:
1. Each question must be answerable with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.
2. Each question must contain concepts of the {}.
3. Each question should minimize the subjectivity of the rater’s judgment. 
4. The semantic redundancy between sub-questions should be minimized. 
5. Formulate questions so that a ‘Yes’ answer is a positive answer.
6. Please combine any questions that ask about similar characteristics into a single question.
7. Each sub-question must focus on asking about the presence of positive aspects rather than the absence of negative ones. For example, ask whether a summary avoids negative elements rather than contains them.

# Sub-questions

Please provide your ultimate answer in a List format.
