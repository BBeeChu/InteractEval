In this task, you need to create a question to evaluate the {} of the summary of the original document. 
The definition of {} and the questions corresponding to the key component of {} are provided below. 
Use them to generate sub-questions for each key question.

Each sub-question must satisfy the following conditions:
1. Each question must be answerable with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.
2. Each sub-question must incorporate concepts from the key component.
3. Each question should minimize the subjectivity of the rater’s judgment. 
4. The semantic redundancy between sub-questions should be minimized. 
5. Formulate sub-questions so that a ‘Yes’ answer is a positive response.
6. Each sub-question must focus on asking about the presence of positive aspects rather than the absence of negative ones. For example, ask whether a summary avoids negative elements rather than contains them.



# Definition
{}

# Key component and corresponding question 
{}

Please provide your answer in a JSON format with the key of components and the value of the list of sub-questions.
For example, 
{{"key component 1": ["sub question 1", "sub question 2",...] , "key component 2": ["sub question 1", "sub question 2", "sub question 3", ...],
"key component 3": ["sub question 1", "sub question 2", ...], "key component 4": ["sub question 1", "sub question 2", "sub question 3", "sub question 4", ...],...}}
